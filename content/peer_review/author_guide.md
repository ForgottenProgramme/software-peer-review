# Guide for Authors

## Code Style

pyOpenSci encourages authors to consult [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for information on how to style your code.

## Packaging Guide

PyPI has a [short tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) on how to package a Python project for easy installation. Note that the tutorial includes uploading your project to PyPI. We encourage you to submit to pyOpenSci for review before uploading to PyPI.

## Presubmission 
If you are unsure if your package fits within pyOpenSci's [scope](aims_scope), you're encouraged to open a presubmission inquiry issue on the [software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository.

## Submission for Peer Review
To request peer review, start a new issue in the [pyOpenSci/software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository and fill out the "Submit Software for Review" issue template. For more information on the process and timeline for review, see our [section on the review process](peer_review_proc).
